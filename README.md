# Next + Netlify Starter + SchemafreeSQL

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v12 site bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), containing ServerlessApps powered by [SchemafreeSQL](https://schemafreesql.com/) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) AWS lambda Functions! 

The apps are meant to demo SFSQL capabilities and offer it it as a viable option for Serveless environments. One more thing the apps were all created by our non-techie CEO while taking SFSQL for a spin and helping out with testing. The functions (node.js) are [Here](https://github.com/SchemaFreeSQL/netlifysite/tree/main/netlify/functions)
